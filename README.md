# AirBnB clone (The console)
description of project
The goal of the project is to deploy on my own server, a simple copy of the AirBnB website. At the end of 4 months, i should have completed the following:
 	.A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visu	al interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development a	nd debugging)
	.A website (the front-end) that shows the final product 	to everybody: static and dynamic
	.A database or files that store data (data = objects)
	.An API that provides a communication interface between 	the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, u	pdate them)
However, for this first month, we will only focus on building the console
## The console
General requirements:
create your data model
manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
## The Command Interpreter
description of the command interpreter:
The command interpreter is a library (written in C) which allows the creation of programs that can accept commands given interactively by the user or programs that are sequences of commands.This application is responsible for creating the command window, accepting your configuration commands, and providing access to the built-in commands such as the Dir command.
## how to start it
To start a command interpreter, launch the command interpreter.
## how to use it
A command is nothing but a set of instruction you want the command interpreter to perform. Pressing the return key(Enter) executes the command. After a command is executed, a new prompt is issued for accepting next command from the user.
## examples
	. Shell
	. Bash
	. Git
	. Windows CMD
etc
